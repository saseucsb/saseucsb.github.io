					<p>The 2021 SASE West Regional Conference (WRC) hosted by SASE UCSB aims to connect different chapters of SASE from all across the west coast. Twenty-one active chapters in the western region will be present along with a slew of local and national companies, with attendees engaging in bonding activities, professional workshops, and networking opportunities. Our WRC theme “Adapting Amidst Adversity” reflects back on a year of hardships and unexpected change and inspires all of us to recover and move forward with our lives, safely. As such, we plan to host various activities and events during our virtual conference that are a reflection of this theme and the message it stands for.</p>
					<p>One of the main highlights of the conference will be the series of workshops and panels focusing on leadership, technology and entrepreneurship, career development, diversity and inclusion, and social connection. This variety of workshops and panels will feature Q&A sessions, presentations, active interactions between the audience, competitions, and more. We will also have an opening ceremony and closing remarks where certain executives from our sponsors and other companies will speak on their experiences and provide valuable advice to our attendees. Multiple large scale networking sessions will be held during the conference, giving students additional chances to connect with employers and explore different available opportunities in their field in both grouped and 1-on-1 settings. Our conference career fair will be made up of our many networking sessions during the conference and during the days leading up to the conference. During these sessions, we will provide attendees with the opportunity to interact with recruiters within each respective company, so that they have a chance to build their networking skills, have their resumes reviewed, and even score offers for internships and jobs.</p>
					<p>Our fully virtual conference will be realized through an online platform called Socio. Through this, students will have the opportunity to schedule individual networking sessions and showcase their resumes, attend the workshops and panels of their choice, get acquainted with the other attendees, and interact with company recruiters and speakers even before the conference date. Our 2021 SASE West Regional Conference will provide all attendees with the necessary skills and tools they need to persevere and thrive in this changing world to truly embody our theme, “Adapting Amidst Adversity.”</p>

				<h3 class="text-center pt-4"><a id="workshops">Workshops</a></h3>
				<p class="text-center">Below are some of the topics our conference explores.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">Relationships & Networking</h3>
				<p>To successfully land a job, you cannot rely on technical skills alone. As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, it is not enough to simply be good at your job; you must also be able to fit in and work well with others within the company’s work environment. Networking and relationship skills are invaluable qualities for any career-oriented individual. They will not only allow you to showcase your competence in a way a resume cannot replicate, but also help form meaningful relationships with your employer and coworkers. This track will discuss the importance of expanding one’s network to build professional relationships, and teach students how they can increase their own social aptitude to boost their future careers.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">Technology & Innovation</h3>
				<p>Science and engineering is continuously evolving: specialists develop novel techniques, revise past knowledge, and advance a multitude of fields ranging from aeronautics to zoology. What is working in such fast-paced environments like? This track aims to help attendees discover the opportunities available in diverse industries from professionals who have a finger on the pulse in their expertise. Panelists will impart an exclusive inside view of technology and innovation and discuss the expectations for interning and entering company workforces.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">Empowerment - Professional and Personal (Personal Health & Wellness)</h3>
				<p>In today’s day and age, you are constantly exposed to individuals you see as role models and rivals. Because of this, you often forget about our own worth and how hard you have worked to get to where you are today. You often push ourselves too far without realizing the consequences it can have on our health. Mental well-being and attitude is just as important as the hard work you put in. With a good balance between the two, you can greatly improve your performance and image. This track aims to help empower and remind students they are doing well and that their uniqueness from others is what will push them further. In this track, far reaching company representatives will speak about how to overcome this mental battle and show you how to be proud of yourself and your work.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">Culture and Diversity</h3>
				<p>Often overlooked in the workplace is the role that cultural awareness and diversity has in creating a well functioning and streamlined team. Having employees with varying backgrounds helps drive innovative thinking while a sense of mutual understanding brings the team closer. However, prejudices make achieving the goal of a supportive workplace a difficult one. This track will teach attendees more about the role that culture plays in the workplace and beyond. The company representatives will give their first hand experience of how they have overcome the challenges faced in a less diverse workplace and/or tips on how to express your own unique point of view.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">Resilience of a Professional Community</h3>
				<p>A single individual may not be able to overcome the difficulties encountered in the workplace. Professional communities are designed to help tackle this problem. When you enter the workplace, be aware that you are not alone and that people are there to help each other out. Individuals work synergistically to overcome obstacles that before seemed impossible. This feat, however, does come with its own challenges. This track aims to highlight the importance and implementation of collaboration in the workplace. The focus of this track is to introduce real world examples on how working with your coworkers requires not only understanding, but also patience and compromise.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center pt-4">To Industry and Beyond: The When, Why, & How of Continuing Education</h3>
				<p>The further you advance in a specific field, the more you are expected to know and learn. Oftentimes, however, recent graduates do not see the path of continuing education as a pressing concern. Once you’ve gotten your first degree and a comfortable job, why go back to school? What does graduate school provide that the workplace does not? In today’s society, many industries require individuals to have not only a bachelors, but also a masters or a PhD. The purpose of this panel track is to help students see the importance, benefits, and rewards of pursuing higher education. Panelists in this track will share why they decided to continue pursuing academia as well as their positive and negative experiences.</p>
